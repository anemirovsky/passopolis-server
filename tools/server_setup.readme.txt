Steps to setup passopolis/mitro on Ubuntu 14.04:

1. Edit server_setup.sh to replace db values with yours.
2. sudo ./server_setup.sh
3. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/Apache for configuring
mod_proxy/mod_proxy_http. Apache is handling SSL and we're forwarding along
to localhost:8080 which Jetty is listening to.
4. Edit mitro.conf to replace db values with yours.
5. sudo cp mitro.conf to /etc/init/mitro.conf
6. sudo ln -s /etc/init/mitro.conf /etc/init.d/mitro
7. Edit server host for each extension at chrome-extension://gknclpdgpfkfckamhononecbipkbmpil/html/preferences.html.
